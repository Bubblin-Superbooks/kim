No! In nineteen pitched battles was I; in six-and-forty skirmishes of horse; and in small affairs without number.

They said: "Give him the Order of Berittish India." I carry it upon my neck now. I have also my jaghir [holding] from the hands of the State—a free gift to me and mine. The men of the old days—they are now Commissioners—come riding to me through the crops—high upon horses so that all the village sees—and we talk out the old skirmishes, one dead man's name leading to another.'</p><p>'And after?' said the lama.</p></div> </div>
